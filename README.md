Stage 1 and 2 of Popular Movies app 

Hello, here is my very advanced application Popular Movies. It is a project for Udacity course - Android Developer Fast Track. 

You can discover and explore popular and top-rated movies from https://www.themoviedb.org/

In order to run my app on your device, you need to have a valid API key. You can ask for one on https://www.themoviedb.org/
If you already have one, you can add it in Keys.java file.

Have fun! :-)


P.S. 
If you have any suggestions on how I could improve my app, feel free to contact me.
